# Spread-Cluster With Local Data

This is an implementation of this setup:
https://docs.quobyte.com/docs/16/latest/network_setup.html#spread-cluster-with-local-data

It uses one cluster partitioned into two aggregates and demonstrates how data can be moved back and forth.
One use case can be a large on premise storage that is extended dynamically in a cloud environment to 
satisfy capacity bursts.
