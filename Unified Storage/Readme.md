# This case demonstrates how Quobyte can be used to

* Use unified user identities across different access methods (S3, native client)
* Use unified access rules across different access methods (S3, native client)
* And of course see how the same data can be written, read or modified independently 
of different access methods. 


## Reduce trusted networks to only storage servers 

Excluding any native client enforces that clients need to authenticate.

## Set up S3

Setting a host name and starting a S3 proxy.

## Create different tenants, users and access keys

Using an file access key resolves to a user and a tenant.
This way we can isolate storage consumption per, for example, 
organizational unit.
